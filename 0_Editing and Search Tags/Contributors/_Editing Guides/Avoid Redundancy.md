To keep the Obsidian vault well-organized and avoid granularity or redundancy, refer to this guide in creating, updating, or peer reviewing updates:

1. **Maintain Clear Naming Conventions:** Use consistent and descriptive titles for notes, images, folders and other document types.                                                     
2. **Create Hierarchical Structure:** Organize notes and folders hierarchically based on topics, projects, or workflows. 
	- Use naming conventions to group related notes and folders together. 
	- Avoid creating too many levels of nesting to prevent complexity.
    
3. **Use Tags and Metadata:** Consider the existing tagging system to categorize notes by topics, technologies, skills, or relevant criteria. 
	- Standardize tag names and use them consistently across notes to facilitate searching and filtering. 
	- Create templates when it's time effective.
	- Use metadata such as creation/updated date and add a Related section to notes for better organization (see [[Creating Content]] for Related section).
    
4. **Centralize Resources:** Maintain a central folder for resource types such as PDFs and images. 
	- This includes linking articles, tutorials, documentation, and best practices within the relevant note or canvas. 
	- Use dedicated notes or folders to store links, PDFs, and other files, and keep them updated regularly.
    
5. **Utilize Linking and Cross-Referencing:** Foster a culture of linking and cross-referencing between notes to establish connections and provide context. 
	- *Related section:* should reference related note markdowns and search tags. This keeps the Graph View cohesive and search time optimal.
	- *Metadata:* Each note as of 3/4/24 should include a created date or updated property. Refer to [Obsidian Docs](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/show-creation-and-update-date/341) for reference.
    
8. **Regular Maintenance and Review:** Contributors are engineers and other tech professionals who volunteer their time to keep this resource accurate, organized, and results-driven. 
	- *Utilize this network:* If you want to attend tech mocks, contribute, or find ways to get involved refer to the README.   
	- *House keeping:* With each new update or feature, we-
	- remove outdated or irrelevant notes. 
	- update tags and metadata as needed. 
	- ensure that the organization structure remains effective. 
	We encourage users to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you have feedback you want to provide, the Interest Form is linked in the [[README]]. 
    
9. **Document Best Practices:** To make it easier for contributors, users, and editors to use this resource, independently review, and provide feedback--> we have this resource + 
	- [[Markdown Formatting Overview]] and [[Editing Reference]] as a shorthand for [Obsidian Docs](https://help.obsidian.md/Home).  
	- [[Creating Folders]] and [[Creating Content]] for effective note-taking, tagging, linking, and collaboration to help users navigate and contribute to the vault efficiently.
