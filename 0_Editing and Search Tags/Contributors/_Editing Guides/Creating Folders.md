## Before Creating Folders
First consider the current folder structure 
- Can your new notes live under any of the existing folders? 

To review the folder structure, you can use the *tree* command in your terminal or use your *side bar*.
You can also use the *Tags Directory* or *Graph View* to search related topic locations.

**Using Tree Command**
Example: *Assuming you're typing this from the EngineerAtlas directory of your terminal*
```
tree _Interview\ Prep
```

*If you don't have the tree command installed*
```
brew install tree
```
*Check to make sure tree command is installed*
```
tree --version
```
