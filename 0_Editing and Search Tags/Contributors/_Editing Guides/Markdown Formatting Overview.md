Markdown formatting encompasses a variety of text styling and structuring elements beyond just linking. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting syntax to define elements such as headings, lists, emphasis (bold and italic), links, images, code blocks, and more. Here are some common elements of Markdown formatting:

1. **Headings:** Markdown allows you to create headings of different levels using the hash (#) symbol. For example, "# Heading 1" creates a level 1 heading, "## Heading 2" creates a level 2 heading, and so on.
    
2. **Lists:** Markdown supports both ordered (numbered) and unordered (bullet) lists. For unordered lists, you can use asterisks (*), plus signs (+), or hyphens (-) to create list items. For ordered lists, you can use numbers followed by periods.
    
3. **Emphasis:** Markdown allows you to add emphasis to text using asterisks (*) or underscores (_). Surrounding text with one asterisk or underscore will italicize it, while surrounding it with two will bold it.
    
4. **Links:** Markdown enables you to create hyperlinks by enclosing the link text in square brackets [] followed by the URL in parentheses (). For example, "[Link Text](https://example.com/)".
    
5. **Images:** Similar to links, Markdown allows you to insert images into your text using an exclamation mark (!) followed by square brackets containing alt text and parentheses containing the image URL.
    
6. **Code Blocks:** Markdown supports code blocks, which are useful for displaying code snippets. You can create code blocks by indenting the code with four spaces or by enclosing it in triple backticks (```).
    
7. **Blockquotes:** Markdown allows you to create blockquotes by prefixing text with a greater than sign (>). Blockquotes are commonly used for quoting external sources or adding emphasis to text.
    
8. **Horizontal Rules:** Markdown supports horizontal rules, which are used to visually separate sections of content. Horizontal rules can be created by placing three or more hyphens (-), asterisks (*), or underscores (_) on a line by themselves.
    
9. **Escape Characters:** Markdown allows you to escape special characters, such as asterisks or underscores, by preceding them with a backslash (). This prevents Markdown from interpreting them as formatting syntax.
    

Overall, Markdown formatting offers a simple and intuitive way to structure and stylize plain text content for various purposes, including note-taking, documentation, messaging, and more.
