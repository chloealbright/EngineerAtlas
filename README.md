![EngineerAtlas-2-19-24](https://github.com/chloealbright/EngineerAtlas/assets/57193454/d09ee99d-cfea-469c-89fb-f1fc5b3e38c3)
## Overview
‚öôÔ∏èüìë EngineerAtlas serves as a knowledge management and collaboration tool for engineers, enabling them to seamlessly share and collaborate on interview preparation materials, learning resources, project documentation, and knowledge sharing initiatives. It can be used in application with engineering development and skill-building to
* ‚è±Ô∏è Save time
* üìë Document & skillshare industry experience
* üí• Reduce decision fatigue, stay organized, & optimize workflows

The idea behind this Obsidian tool stems from a need to facillitate the challenges I've witnessed many engineers face while working in startups. Aside from the _play hard / work hard_ mentality, there remains a real need to optimize resources, leverage data, and develop the right tools at the right time. In reality, early-stage engineering teams are often spread thin with the work to headcount ratio and much of the useful information regarding engineering decisions, docunmentation, and other technical considerations 
```js 
if(!documented){
   // useful info escapes between the cycles of development and deployment
}
else{
   // never sees the light of day once engineers switch teams, companies, or tech stacks
}

```

EngineerAtlas aims to solve this problem by providing a shared knowledge base for the following resources:

## üìÇ Folder Structure
* ### _Interview Prep
   * Mock Tech & Behavioral Interview Process.
   * Including interview questions, coding challenges, time and solution breakdown.
* ### _Learning and Documentation
   * Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) review including.
      * Algorithm topics, uses cases, implementations, shorthand for interviews. 
      * Data Structure types, use cases, exceptions, considerations, and code blocks.
   * APIs and Data Pipelining
     * Including an Overview, technical considerations, design, and implementations.
   * Languages and Frameworks
      * Including language and framework breakdown, language overlaps and implementations for optimized learning.
   * Software Development
      * Including Software Design, Programming Styles, and other methodologies to consider in your development.
   * Codebase Maintenance and Exploration
      * Index and search through codebases to quickly locate files, functions, and classes.
      * Document codebase architecture, design decisions, and code patterns.
      * Create and maintain technical debt logs, bug reports, and feature requests.
      * Integrate with version control systems to track changes and updates.
* ### _Project Management and Routines
   * Includes guides for organizing personal tasks, goals, and habits using productivity frameworks and additional resources.
   * Guides on documenting project requirements, specifications, and user stories.
* ### _Knowledge Sharing and Experience:
   * Share insights, best practices, and lessons learned with colleagues and the community.
   * Collaborate with other engineer contributors on projects and technical articles.
   * Host virtual/hybrid workshops, study groups, and coding sessions.
   * Provide feedback and peer review on code, documentation, and presentations.


Every innovative solution stems from a problem. Whether you're busy developing end-to-end features, testing, preparing for your next role/interview, or in back-to-back meetings, you can rest assured that your engineering references can be easily shared within teams and used to help with everyday technical decisions, skill-building, and project management considerations. 

## Features

* Linking & Mapping- tags and internal linking between notes utilizes Obsidian's Mind Map feature in Graph View, enabling users to view relational topics, keep notes organized, enhance learning & development.

* Topics covered- _**‚òÄÔ∏èWe're growingüå±**_ The current release of this vault covers these folders: _Interview Prep, Learning and Documentation, Routines & Project Management_.  

* Continuous Updates-  _**‚òÄÔ∏èWe're growingüå±** _We have 6 contributors (5 engineers + 1 founder) and counting! As the libraries (2nd-level folders) and resources continue to grow so too will our knowledge base and contributors, keeping this vault up-to-date!

* Easy Reading & Skimming through topics- This vault is mostly written like a guide, dictionary, and decision tree, therefore it avoids getting too granular about the details. _Use the Tags Directory and Graph Map Features to guide your search_       

* Choose your time-commitment level- only have 5-10 minutes to immerse yourself in a topic? Filter topics by tags to review by time-commitment: 1-5 mins #quickread, 5-10 mins #insightful for medium-length reads, and #deepdive for 30 mins & over. 

* Growing Libraries & Features- Future features of this vault will include decision trees and maps to help continuous learning and development.
