# EngineerAtlas
## Overview
‚öôÔ∏èüìë EngineerAtlas is an OS tool used in application with engineering development and skill-building to
* ‚è±Ô∏è Save time
* üìë Document / skillshare industry experience
* üí• Reduce decision fatigue & optimize workflows

'A kid learns a thing or 2 working with startups. Besides the _play hard / work hard_ mentality, there remains a real need to optimize resources, leverage data, and develop the right tools at the right time. In reality, much of the useful information regarding technical decisions and considerations 
```js 
if(!documented){
   // useful info escapes between the cycles of development and deployment
}
else{
   // never sees the light of day once engineers switch teams, companies, or tech stacks
}

```

EngineerAtlas solves that problem by providing a collaborative knowledge base for engineers to peer review and share the following resources:
* ### Interview Preparation
   * Mock Tech & Behavioral Interview Process.
   * Including interview questions, coding challenges, and solutions.
* ### Learning and Documentation
   * Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) review including.
      * Algorithm topics, uses cases, implementations, shorthand for interviews. 
      * Data Structure types, use cases, exceptions, considerations, and code blocks.
   * APIs and Data Pipelining
     * Including an Overview, tecnical considerations, design, and implementations.
   * Languages and Frameworks
      * Including language and framework breakdown, language overlaps and implementations for optimized learning.
   * Software Development
      * Including Software Design, Programming Styles, and other methodologies to consider in your development.
   * Codebase Maintenance and Exploration
      * Index and search through codebases to quickly locate files, functions, and classes.
      * Document codebase architecture, design decisions, and code patterns.
      * Create and maintain technical debt logs, bug reports, and feature requests.
      * Integrate with version control systems to track changes and updates.
* ### Project Management
   * Includes guides for organizing personal tasks, goals, and habits using productivity frameworks and additional resources.
   * Guides on documenting project requirements, specifications, and user stories.
* ### Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration:
   * Share insights, best practices, and lessons learned with colleagues and the community.
   * Collaborate with other engineer contributors on projects and technical articles.
   * Host virtual/hybrid workshops, study groups, and coding sessions.
   * Provide feedback and peer review on code, documentation, and presentations.
  
Every innovative solution stems from a problem. Whether you're busy developing key features, testing, reviewing code, creating infrastructure, building data pipelines or in back-to-back meetings, you can rest assured that your engineering references can be easily shared within teams and used to help in everyday technical decisions and management considerations. 

## Features

* Linking & Mapping- tags and internal linking between notes utilizes Obsidian's Mind Map feature in Graph View, enabling users to view relational topics, keep notes organized, enhance learning & development.

* Topics covered- The current release of this vault will cover Interview Prep & Mock Interviews, Languages & Frameworks, Documentation & Testing, Routines & Project Management.  

* Continuous Updates- we have about 4 contributors and counting! As the libraries (top-level folders)  and notes continue to grow so too will our knowledge base and contributors, keeping this vault up-to-date.

* Easy Reading & Skimming through topics- This vault is mostly written like a guide, dictionary, and decision tree, therefore it avoids getting too granular about the details.       

* Choose your time-commitment level- only have 5-10 minutes to immerse yourself in a topic? Filter topics by tags to review by time-commitment: 1-5 mins #quickread, 5-10 mins #insightful for medium-length reads, and #deepdive for 30 mins & over. 

* Growing Libraries & Features- Future features of this vault will include decision trees and maps to help continuous learning and development. 

## Perks 
* ‚öôÔ∏è User-friendly UX/UI design and functionality
* Dark mode | Light Mode üëì
* Access engineer helper tools, guides, and updates from a single source üåê
