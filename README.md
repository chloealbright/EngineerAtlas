# EngineerAtlas
## Overview long
Every innovative solution stems from a problem. From the moment I led the development of my senior project, Animal Mafia, as a product owner, scrum master, and engineer, I understood the challenges that came with collaborating and developing ambitious ideas from scratch. 

Beyond leading the project management and code reviews, outlining technical requirements, developing user-stories, testing, and weekly deployment of key features, there's still a vast amount of helpful information that escapes between the cycles of development and deployment.

This came to my attention while developing dashboard features that provided real-time financial insights at a pre-seed fintech. Developing documentation to enhance your engineering roadmap, services architecture, and onboarding process for new engineers can be overwhelming when coupled with meeting potential clients, achieving security compliance, and well-- coding. In the world of startups and VCs, (or college) you're essentially wearing many hats. 

## Overview short 
What this vault is-- 

An open source (OS) tool used by engineers (& other tech professionals) to 

* guide their interview prep, assessment, and strategies
* guide their engineering development and project management

* enhance their decision model around software tools & libraries, software design & architecture, and other tech considerations when deriving tech solutions.
* enhance their learning strategies around data structures & problem solving, learning new tech skills & becoming language-agnostic  

* contribute their professional / technical experiences & resources
* innovate & connect with other engineers & professionals aligned in work ethic, adopting a growth mindset, and building professional community


What this vault isn't--
* this is vault is not your personal notebook or personal project management tool, as such- internal company information, classified, and personal information is prohibited.
   
* this vault won't teach you how to code and assumes you've taken the traditional courses at a 4-year Computer Science or related-engineering program.


## Features

* Linking & Mapping- tags and internal linking between notes utilizes Obsidian's Mind Map feature in Graph View, enabling users to view relational topics, keep notes organized, enhance learning & development.

* Topics covered- The current release of this vault will cover Interview Prep & Mock Interviews, Languages & Frameworks, Documentation & Testing, Routines & Project Management.  

* Continuous Updates- we have about 4 contributors and counting! As the libraries (top-level folders)  and notes continue to grow so too will our knowledge base and contributors, keeping this vault up-to-date.

* Easy Reading & Skimming through topics- This vault is mostly written like a guide, dictionary, and decision tree, therefore it avoids getting too granular about the details.       

* Choose your time-commitment level- only have 5-10 minutes to immerse yourself in a topic? Filter topics by tags to review by time-commitment: 1-5 mins #quickread, 5-10 mins #insightful for medium-length reads, and #deepdive for 30 mins & over. 

* Growing Libraries & Features- Future features of this vault will include decision trees and maps to help continuous learning and development. 

## Perks
