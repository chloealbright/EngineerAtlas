Here are some major programming paradigms:

1. **Imperative Programming:**
    
    - **Definition:** Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates and changes the program state.
    - **Example:** Procedural programming languages like C, Pascal.
2. **Declarative Programming:**
    
    - **Definition:** Declarative programming focuses on describing what a program should accomplish without specifying how to achieve it.
    - **Example:** SQL (Structured Query Language) for database queries.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    
    - **Definition:** OOP is centered around the concept of "objects" that encapsulate data and behavior.
    - **Example:** Java, Python, C++.
4. **Functional Programming:**
    
    - **Definition:** Functional programming emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens and avoids changing state and mutable data.
    - **Example:** Haskell, Lisp, Scala.
5. **Event-Driven Programming:**
    
    - **Definition:** Event-driven programming is based on the occurrence of events, and the program responds to these events.
    - **Example:** GUI programming, JavaScript in web development.
6. **Logic Programming:**
    
    - **Definition:** Logic programming is based on formal logic and involves expressing program logic as a set of statements in logical form.
    - **Example:** Prolog.
7. **Parallel Programming:**
    
    - **Definition:** Parallel programming involves the simultaneous execution of tasks to improve performance.
    - **Example:** CUDA for parallel computing on GPUs.
8. **Scripting Languages:**
    
    - **Definition:** Scripting languages are often used for automation and are interpreted rather than compiled.
    - **Example:** Python, Ruby, Bash.
9. **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP):**
    
    - **Definition:** AOP aims to modularize cross-cutting concerns, such as logging and security, that affect multiple parts of a program.
    - **Example:** AspectJ.
10. **Concurrent Programming:**
    
    - **Definition:** Concurrent programming involves the execution of multiple tasks concurrently, often used in systems with multiple processors or cores.
    - **Example:** Java concurrency, Go.

These paradigms are not mutually exclusive, and many programming languages support multiple paradigms. Programmers often choose the paradigm that best fits the requirements of the specific problem they are trying to solve.
