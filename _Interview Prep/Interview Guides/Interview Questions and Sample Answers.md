## Interview questions with sample answers

### 1. What is the most difficult project you have worked on, and how did you get through the challenging tasks?

**Example:** “I once worked on an engineering project that involved developing predictions about mountains and the roadways near them. I changed the data that I was used to working with to include any climate or environmental changes, as the risk factors changed based on the wildlife, the weather and the people in that area. With these adaptations, I was able to complete the project despite how challenging I thought it was in the beginning.”

- Describe your ability to work on complex and tasking projects that involve multiple resources, timelines and teams. 
- Your response shows that you can multitask and manage your time well. 
- If you have any first-hand experience with challenging engineering situations, offer to describe that too.

### 2. How do you explain engineering ideas to an audience who’s unfamiliar with the topic during a presentation or an important meeting?

**Example:** “I do my best to give examples of engineering that are easy to understand and that might relate to a person or their situation. For instance, if I’m sitting down with a group of construction works, I will compare what I am saying to the process of how roads are paved. Relating the engineering ideas to real situations gives my audience a better understanding every time.”

- Communicate your ability to work with many people during projects. 
- Give a short example of explaining a software development issue to someone of any skill level. 
- Your answer should clarify that you have a strong understanding of engineering concepts.

### 3. What do you do to manage your time and stay on schedule and have your time management skills improved since starting your career?

**Example:** “Before I begin any work, I set aside some time to prioritize what tasks need to be done right away, and follow my list, doing the most time-sensitive parts first. Using this process has kept me on time and continues to improve my time-management skills.”

- Expand on your project management abilities.
- Discuss how developed your time-management skills are. 
- How you continue to improve those skills? 

### 4. What kind of safety procedures do you have in place for when you check your engineering work for mistakes? Do the procedures ensure that you don’t overlook any mistakes?

**Example:** “My engineering solution has features to constantly check for mistakes or errors, and I always triple-check any measurements or math that I’m working with. Whether I’m rushing to meet deadlines or not, I get a fellow engineer to check my work before marking it as complete. Implementing these steps makes it easy to ensure there aren’t any mistakes.”

- Give examples of how you approach safety measures at work and how you would minimize potential issues. 
- A good answer will explain your knowledge of safety standards for your engineering specialization and will show your drive to keep projects safe.

### 5. What is your favorite type of work to do in the engineering field?

**Example:** “My favorite projects are those that include helping the wildlife populations and curing sick animals. I assisted with the plans for a new exotic animal hospital, and I was so happy to be doing something that was going to be so beneficial to those animals.”

- When you answer this question, make sure you show your enthusiasm for your specialty or favorite work. 
- If hired, the company will likely use the information from this question to place you in the teams best suited to you. 
- Your answer should explain why you enjoy that particular type of engineering and also give examples of your previous engineering projects.
