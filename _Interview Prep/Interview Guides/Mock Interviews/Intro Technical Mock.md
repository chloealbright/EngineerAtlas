**Approach**

During the first few mocks (*or however many*), participants choose a Leetcode problem to be tested on.  

**Considerations ðŸ“‹

Eventually this gets phased out for random problems given by the interviewer for the interviewee to solve. 

This allows participants to collaborate, build comfortability around white boarding, live-problem solving, & communicating through algorithms during their technical interviews.


**Process

 1. Each Interviewee chooses a [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) problem to be tested on and sends this to the *Groupchat* / *Interviewer* pre-Mock so that both participants come prepared. 
 2. Each Interviewee gets 45 mins to solve the problem: 
	  + *5 minutes:* intro / reading question
	  + *5-10 minutes:* clarifying all edge cases, and designing the algorithm.Â  
	  + *15-20 minutes:* writing the code.
	  + *Remaining Time:* to Test and Debug. 
 3. *During the Interview:* Interviewers & Interviewees are encouraged to ask questions. Interviewers can ask questions around how the interviewee is approaching the problem and Interviewees can ask questions reasonable questions around methods and documentation.
 4. *Feedback* will be provided at the end based on an assessment scale to help participants prepare for the following tech mocks. See [[Interview Prep Objectives]] to guide feedback.
 
**Technology**
+ For Tech Mock Meets we use Google Meets or Zoom
+ For coding --> Codepad | Leetcode *Shared screen*
+ For white board --> Google Jamboard
+ For GroupChat, sharing Leetcode Problems/etc --> Discord

**Virtual and In-Person** *as of 2/15/24*
+ **In-person:** We usually meet at coffee shops, libraries, or co-working spaces depending on the participants. In-person was the preferred choice when first developing a plan around Engineering Meets and Interview Prep.
+ **Virtual**: Virtual has been the preferred choice since ramping up weekly tech mocks.
+ **Hybrid** Offers the most flexibility for participants and enables practice for in-person interviews and technical screen calls. We switch between virtual and in-person based on the participants' availability.
