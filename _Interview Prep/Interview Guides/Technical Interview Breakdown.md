#### Time Budgeting

For a 45 minute coding interview with one question, budget-
* *5 minute*s intro.
* *5-10 minutes* reading question, clarifying all edge cases, and designing the algorithm.  
* When explaining the algorithm, write down bullets on the code pad screen. 
* ^This makes it easy to reference later when writing the code.  Common mistake is to rush this step.
* *15-20 minutes* writing the code. 
* ^As mentioned previously, use the bullets in algorithm step as guidance.
* Remaining Time to Test and Debug.
