The [Interviewer's assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nS41AQTLAZwCOEhBhrwpoqh5Y7kePWJbSpo1RXHjTF0/edit#heading=h.kp8q0b8j3i66) of your performance is usually based on:
+ Analytical Skills
+ Coding Skills
+ Did you display this throughout your interview process?
+ Experience
+ Culture fit / Communication skills

### Analytical Skills 
- Can break down coding problems with little to no outside help
    
- Able to use brute force approach when introduced to new coding problems before revisiting in for an optimal approach 
    
- Assesses common expectations, use cases, edge cases, security, & data structure efficiency, providing optimal solutions
    
- Able to efficiently identify the problem, develop use cases/edge cases, provide secure and efficient coding solutions within a reasonable time limit
    
- When challenged with designing/architecting a new solution, is able to structure the problem well and think/talk through the tradeoffs of different decisions
    
### Coding Skills
- Proven ability to white board algorithms and translate it to reasonable code
    
- Writes clean and well organized code displaying OOP principles / Architecture / Design Knowledge
    
- Identifies and addresses potential errors via code
    
- Displays a good style of coding for different problem areas and use cases 

### Computer Science Fundamentals / Data Structures

Displays a strong foundation in computer science, relevant technologies– 

- Verbally– communicates Data structure knowledge: runtime complexity, binary search trees, linked lists, etc, Software Design Principles & their limits, Software Design Rules & their exceptions, Architecture Design & Infrastructure.
    
- via Projects– uses pertinent technology for their projects & communicates the trade offs
    
- via Code solutions–  identifies problem statement, develops user stories & algorithms -> code that meet the general expectations for solving the problems, handling edge cases, considering growth rates, time to solve, and designing alternate solutions when possible

- via Interview Process– see Tips for Interviewing
