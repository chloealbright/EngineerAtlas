Building an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline requires a combination of languages and tools. The choice of languages often depends on the specific requirements of the ETL process and the existing technology stack of the organization. Here are some commonly used languages for building ETL pipelines:

1. **SQL (Structured Query Language):**
    
    - Used for data extraction and manipulation from relational databases.
    - Commonly used for querying, filtering, and aggregating data.
2. **Python:**
    
    - Widely used for scripting and automation in ETL processes.
    - Popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and SQLAlchemy are commonly used for data manipulation.
    - Ideal for integrating with various data sources, performing transformations, and loading data.
3. **Java:**
    
    - Used for building robust and scalable ETL applications.
    - Apache libraries such as Apache Beam and Apache NiFi are often used for ETL in Java.
4. **Scala:**
    
    - Compatible with the Apache Spark framework, which is popular for large-scale data processing and ETL.
    - Offers concise syntax and functional programming features.
5. **Ruby:**
    
    - Suitable for small to medium-sized ETL tasks.
    - Often used in combination with frameworks like Apache Nifi or Talend.
6. **R:**
    
    - Particularly useful for statistical analysis and data manipulation.
    - Can be integrated into the ETL pipeline for specific data processing tasks.
7. **Go:**
    
    - Known for its efficiency and simplicity.
    - Suitable for building lightweight ETL components or microservices.
8. **Shell scripting (Bash):**
    
    - Often used for simple ETL tasks or orchestrating multiple ETL processes.
    - Convenient for running command-line tools and utilities.
9. **ETL Tools:**
    
    - Many organizations use dedicated ETL tools like Apache NiFi, Talend, Informatica, Microsoft SSIS, or Apache Airflow. These tools often provide a visual interface for designing ETL workflows without extensive coding.
10. **Spark SQL:**
    
    - A part of the Apache Spark ecosystem, allowing the execution of SQL-like queries on large-scale distributed data.

The choice of language depends on factors such as the complexity of the ETL process, the existing infrastructure, and the expertise of the development team. In many cases, a combination of languages and tools may be used within a single ETL pipeline.
