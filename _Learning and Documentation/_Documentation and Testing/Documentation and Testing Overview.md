    - Best practices for documenting code, projects, and processes
    - Writing clear and concise technical documentation
    - Documenting APIs, libraries, and software architectures
    - Using documentation generators like JSDoc, Sphinx, or DocFX
2. **Testing Methodologies**:
    
    - Introduction to different testing methodologies (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, etc.)
    - Test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD)
    - Strategies for designing effective test cases and test suites
    - Managing test data and test environments
