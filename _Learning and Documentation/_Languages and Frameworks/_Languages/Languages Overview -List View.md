    - **Limited Procedural Capabilities:**
        
        - Primarily declarative, lacks extensive procedural programming features.
        - May require coupling with a procedural language.
    - **Scalability Challenges:**
        
        - Scaling vertically (upgrading hardware) may have limitations.
        - Some NoSQL databases offer better horizontal scaling.
    - **Vendor-Specific Syntax:**
        
        - SQL implementations vary between database vendors.
        - Portability challenges when migrating between systems.
