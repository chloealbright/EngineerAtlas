TipsðŸ’¡:Â 

- When preparing for your interviewâ€“ Keep your focus industry specific. Example: JP Morgan, focus 20% on the company / 80% on the industryâ€” i.e stand out to the specific company that youâ€™re applying to but also focus on the value youâ€™re bringing in your interviews which can be applicable to any company within that industry.
