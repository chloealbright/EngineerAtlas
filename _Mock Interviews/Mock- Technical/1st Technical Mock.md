**Process

 1. Each person chooses a [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/) problem to be tested on. 
 2. During the actual mock we won't have the solution displayed, we'll be given the question we chose and we'll begin the process of breaking it down into steps / solving & communicating through our work. 
 3. Feedback will be provided at the end based on an assessment scale to help us prepare for the following tech mocks.

**Note ðŸ“‹

This only applies to the 1st few mocks to build comfortability around live-problem solving & communicating through algorithms.
