As seen on [[Project Types and Management Tools]], software preferences may vary by project type and company.

**Project tracking** combines project management tools, with other technology, and methods to optimize workflows and productivity.


 **Research**: When choosing between different technology-
- check *feedback* from users to assess the pros, cons, and considerations of using these tools.
- check the *community and ecosystem* of plugins, extensions, and third-party integrations that can enhance the software's value and provide additional resources for users.
- check for comprehensive *support and documentation* for resolving issues, getting assistance with setup and configuration, and learning how to use the software effectively.
‚Ü™Ô∏è üìùNote this can also be applied to choosing different methods or approaches in project management and software development.

Your *decision tree* for developing your own methods and choosing which tech to use should be based on the following-

- **project scale/difficulty:** 
	- personal projects probably don't require a comprehensive project board. **For example**, you can use- 
		- *GitHub Projects:* utilize GitHub's Project Features to create user stories, assign, prioritize, and manage tasks from your repository.
		- *Google Suite:* helpful for collaborative writing, user stories, or peer-review since it's highly accessible. 
		- *Airtable:* highly accessible/user-friendly features for database visualization and project tracking. Great use for personal CRMs. 
		- *Discord:* useful for collaborating on projects, virtual meets, bot/automation features, and open source community/project building (**It's the people's choice**).
	
	- For companies- ^already mentioned plus- 
		- *Slack:* offers useful plugins with GitHub to track Pull Requests (PRs), or create threads for documentation and bugs. *Discord* also has this thread feature. 
		- *Obsidian:* great base for knowledge management and sharing documentation and resources. Utilize Obsidian features such as daily notes, community plugins, and templating to create issue tracking, documentation, and testing with 1/2 the time. **Only caveat** is the setup/learning curve, but you can utilize this vault as your guide to speed track your development setupüí´. 
		- See [[Project Types and Management Tools]] for more.

- **Cost and Value**: *For companies* consideration of the software's cost relative to its features and benefits is important for budget-conscious organizations. Some tools offer free or low-cost plans for small teams, while others may have subscription-based pricing models with tiered pricing based on features and usage.

- **Features and Functionality:** Choose features and functionalities that align with the project's requirements and workflows. This may include-
	- task management, 
	- scheduling, 
	- collaboration tools, 
	- version control, 
	- reporting and analytics, 
	- integrations with other tools, and customizable workflows.

- **Ease of Use and User Experience:**
	- software should be intuitive and user-friendly, 
	- a clean and accessible interface that facilitates adoption by team members. 
	- a smooth user experience can help increase productivity and reduce the learning curve for new users.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:**
	- scalable to accommodate the needs of growing teams and projects, 
	- ability to adapt to changing requirements and workflows. 
	- it should also offer flexibility in customization and configuration to support different project methodologies and team preferences.

 - **Integration Capabilities**: Integration with other tools and systems used by the team is essential for seamless collaboration and data synchronization. It should offer integrations with- 
	 - popular development tools, 
	 - communication platforms, 
	 - version control systems, 
	 - project management frameworks.
    
- **Collaboration and Communication Features**: Effective communication and collaboration are critical for project success. The software should provide features such as- 
	- real-time messaging, 
	- file sharing, 
	- commenting, 
	- task assignments, 
	- notifications to facilitate communication and coordination among team members.
    
- **Security and Data Privacy**: Protection of sensitive project data and intellectual property is paramount. The software should adhere to industry standards for data security and privacy, with 
	- robust access controls, 
	- encryption, 
	- data backups, 
	- compliance certifications where applicable.
    


## Project Trackers Example

For  [Interview Prep](Interview%20Prep%20Overview.md) I used Google Drive- Sheets + Docs for low lift maintenance and easy collaboration and peer review from founders and engineers.

[Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/) for tracking time spent coding and developing metrics.
Obviously for project development, you can also use Linear,  Jira, Trello, etc..

Additionally, see [Measuring Developer Productivity 17 IRL-Examples across Big Tech](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/measuring-developer-productivity-bae?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=458709&post_id=140740783&utm_campaign=email-post-title&isFreemail=true&r=1okywr&utm_medium=email)
